title: My Music Taste
---

My music taste is actually quite polarized. On the one hand I like very relaxing indie music, where I can shut down and relax. On the other hand I like very hard techno. It is easy to show people my relaxed taste, mostly they like it too. For techno however, it is uch arder to find likeminded people. During my year in Berlin that was a different situation of course and I couldn't get enough of techno.
