Since I was little I have been obsessed with airplanes. I know everything about commercial airliners and I read avaition news every day. Born and raised in Frankfurt, I'm very loyal to Lufthansa and the Lufthansa Group that owns Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and Air Dolomiti. The group recently also acquired ITA Airways and is the biggest group in Europe.

My family and I are Star Alliance ultras and we will stay so for life.

I can identify every airplane type, even from the ground when looking up in the sky. That's how obsessed I am.
