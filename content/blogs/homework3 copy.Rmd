# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources: 

1. [Register of Members’ Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/), 
1. [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
1. [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/). 


## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)
```

There 7 tables in this database.

## Which MP has received the most amount of money? 

```{r}
#creating the object for members
members_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"members")


#This is code that I derived with help from ChatGPT in order to extract the year from the date column in payments 
data <- dbGetQuery(sky_westminster, "SELECT * FROM payments")

data$year <- str_extract(data$date, "\\d{4}")

dbWriteTable(sky_westminster, "payments", data, overwrite = TRUE)


#creating the object for payments
payments_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"payments") 



#joining payments and members
member_payments_db <- left_join(payments_db ,members_db %>% 
                                  
                                  rename(member_id = "id"), by = "member_id") %>% 
  
  select(name, party_id, member_id, entity, value, year) 



#determining the value of donations by MP
max_mp_payment_dp <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(name) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(total_donations))

max_mp_payment_dp
```

As we can see in the table, Theresa May received the highest amount of donations at 2,809,765.42 GBP


## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?

```{r}
#determining entities with 5% or higher
entity_donations <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  mutate(overall_total = sum(total_donations, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% mutate(share = total_donations/overall_total) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(share))

entity_donations
```


Whiters LLP is the only entity that has more than 5% in donation share.

```{r}
#retrieving the distinct MPs that Whithers donated to
whiters_donations <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  filter(entity == "Withers LLP") %>% 
  
  group_by(name) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE))

whiters_donations
```

They donated all 1,812,732 GBP to Geoffrey Cox

## Do `entity` donors give to a single party or not?

- How many distinct entities who paid money to MPS are there?
- How many (as a number and %) donated to MPs belonging to a single party only?

```{r}
#determining number of distinct entities
member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity) %>% 
  
  summarise(sum = n()) %>% 
  
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  summarise(entities = n())
```

There are 2213 distinct entities.

```{r}
#creating the object for the partie database
parties_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"parties")



#joining parties with the already joined mebers and payments tables
party_payment_db <- left_join(member_payments_db,parties_db %>% 
                                
                                rename(party_id = "id",Party = "name"), by = "party_id")



#determining number of entities that have contributed to only one party
party_payment_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity,Party) %>% 
  
  summarise(donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),.groups = "drop_last") %>% #simply summarising to be able to count the rows created from the grouping
  
  summarise(entity_party = n(),.groups = "drop_last") %>% #counting the number of contributions by entity
  
  filter(entity_party == 1) %>% #filtering for entities that have only contributed once (one party only)
  
  summarise(solo_contributors = n())
```

2036 of these entities only contributed to one party.

```{r}
#creating a dataframe manually because after left joining the two previous summaries it returns 0 when mutating for a share
solo_entity_share <- tibble(total_entities = 2213,solo_contributors = 2036, share = 2036/2213 )        
                                                      
solo_entity_share


```

This is a share of 92%

## Which party has raised the greatest amount of money in each of the years 2020-2022? 

-  Write code that visualizes the required data according to the following table

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/img/total_donations_table.png", "total_donations_table.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#pulling party donations from the database list
party_donations_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"party_donations") 

#changing the string date into a year integer
party_donations_db <- party_donations_db %>% 
  
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  
  select(-date,-nature_of_donation,-donation_id) #dropping unnecessary columns


#matching party donations with party information to match for party names
party_name_donations_db <- left_join(party_donations_db,parties_db %>% 
                                    
                                    rename(party_id = "id"), by = "party_id") %>% 
  
  select(-party_id,-abbrev,-background,-foreground,-entity) %>% #dropping unnecessary columns
  
  relocate(name) %>% #resorting columns according to screenshot
  
  relocate(year) 
  
  #determining party contribution by year
donations_by_party_year_db <- party_name_donations_db %>% 
  
  filter(year > 2019) %>% 
  
  group_by(year,name) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_year_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),.groups = "drop_last") %>% 
  
  group_by(year) %>% 
  
  mutate(sum = sum(total_year_donations, na.rm = TRUE),prop = total_year_donations/sum) %>% #calculate yearly proportion by party
  
  select(-sum) #drop temporary column needed for prop calculation

#removing scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)
  

donations_by_party_year_db
```


- Based on the data, plot the following chart

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r , out.width="80%"}
#turning database into dataframe
party_donation_df <- donations_by_party_year_db %>% 
  
  collect() %>% 
  
  filter(total_year_donations > 700000) %>% #filtering out parties with less than 700,000 in donations
  
  #adding factor levels according to contribution levels for graph sorting
  mutate(Party = factor(name, levels = c("Conservative","Labour","Sinn Féin","Liberal Democrats")))
  

#plotting column chart
ggplot(party_donation_df, aes(year,total_year_donations, fill=Party)) +
  
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  
  labs(title = "Conservatives have captured the majority of political donations", subtitle = "Donations above £700,000 to political parties, 2020-2022", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  
  #adding GBP and comma to the y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar(prefix = "£")) 
```

Finally, when you are done working with the databse, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)
```
