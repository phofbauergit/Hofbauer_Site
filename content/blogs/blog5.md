# A flashback

Over the past year I have been studying at London Business School as part of the Master in Financial Analysis to master Finance and enter the industry with a strong skillset that will help me be as successful as I want to be.

The diversity of subjects was very fulfilling and I learned so much. I'm so grateful that I am one of only 210 students, who got accepted this year. I worked hard during my undergrad to get here and the joy I felt when I got my acceptance letter was amazing.

Without sounding cheesy, one of my favorite was the Data Analytics course in my first semester. Many of my fellow student stsruggled hard with R, but I had loads of fun and really appreciated the teaching of Professor Christodoulou. This experience was what convinced me to select Data Science for Business as one of my electives in my third semester. It is a natural continuation of the previous course and once again I really enjoyed all the exercises, even though I struggled with some parts from time to time. In the end it is pretty rewarding and the reason why I'm able to write this blogpost for you today.
