# My life

I have a strong educational background in economics and finance. I completed a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad del Pacifico, where I excelled in courses such as Postgraduate Math, Portfolio Management, and Econometrics. Following that, I pursued a BSc degree in Economics and Finance from the University of London, with academic direction from the London School of Economics, and achieved First Class Honours. During my studies, I focused on courses such as Mathematical Economics, Quantitative Finance, and Asset Pricing.

In 2020, I had the opportunity to participate in the XIII Summer Program in Advanced Finance at the Central Bank of Peru (BCRP) and ranked 1st among 29 students. This program provided me with valuable knowledge in areas such as stochastic calculus, interest rate structures, and portfolio management.

I gained practical business experience at the Central Bank of Peru (BCRP) as a Money Market Trader. In this role, I managed a substantial portfolio and outperformed the benchmark. I conducted backtesting of various trading strategies, collaborated on projects to develop nowcasting for macroeconomic aggregates, and wrote market and strategy reports. Additionally, I worked at Dorado Investments as an Investment Intern, where I developed a trading model and designed reporting systems. I also interned at Apoyo Consultoria, where I worked on projects related to transport company income extrapolation and pharmaceutical market analysis.

Apart from my professional experience, I have engaged in various additional activities. I participated in a Kaggle contest, achieving a 77% accuracy rate in forecasting the surviving probability of the Titanic disaster using different machine learning techniques. I am an investing enthusiast and have backtested mean-reverting strategies in G10 FX. I manage my personal portfolio with a focus on fixed income.

Furthermore, I have been involved in various academic and extracurricular activities. I am a CFA Level 3 Candidate, and I have passed the CFA Level 2 exam with a strong performance in Equity and Fixed Income. I have been a member of the Finance and Investing Club at London Business School and participated in the Varsity Pitch Competition. I have also served as a teacher assistant in Mathematics and CFA 1 Preparation courses at Universidad del Pacifico.

In terms of personal interests, I enjoy cooking, gaming, and playing chess. These activities provide me with relaxation and a creative outlet outside of my professional pursuits.

I hope this provides you with a comprehensive summary of my academic achievements, professional experience, and personal interests. Thank you for considering my application.
